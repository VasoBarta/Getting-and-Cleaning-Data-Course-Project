# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Submission of the Course Project

This repo is a fulfillment of Johns Hopkins Coursera course assignment.

It contains an R script - <strong>run_analysis.R</strong> - which creates an extracted and cleaned dataset from the original source, which contains data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The original data is distributed among several files, and the aim of the script is to create one concise dataset providing information on average value of each variable for each subject and activity.

More information on the dataset and performed transformations is included in the <strong>CodeBook.md</strong>.

The repo contains also the resulting dataset - <strong>tidy_data.txt</strong>.
